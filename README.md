# PyEngine
This is a 2d game engine on Python.


## Components
The engine have components like Trnasform(for coordinates and size), Sprite e. g.
I have done this for comfortable creating of game objects.
The components are in `engine.components` file

In the file `models.py` are creating gameobjects and their components.

## Scripts
In file `scripts.py` you can create game scripts.
For adding script to game you will use decoraters for your functions from `engine.scripts`.

## End
All what you will do: creating game objects and components (models) and writing scripts)
